HICs can use Caredove to enable Clients to self-refer to their services. In this case, the providing HIC is using Caredove as the method to collect PHI from the client",
        " On the online form the client fills in their own information, and is asked directly to provide consent.Principle 5: Limiting Use, Disclosure and RetentionThe  principle of limiting use, disclosure and retention  means PI and PHI shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law.Use and DisclosureThe HIC determines whom to send (disclose) a form containing PHI",
        " Caredove applies a role based access control authorization model. User transactions and access to PHI is based on the user s role established by the organization (receiving HIC) for that user within Caredove.  The licensee of Caredove, or their agent, is responsible for inviting, deleting or otherwise managing users who will be authorized to receive referrals. Credentialing of these users is the responsibility of the Caredove licensee or their agent",
